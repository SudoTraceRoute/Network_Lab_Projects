# üß™ Network Lab Projects

Welcome to the **Network Lab Projects** repository! This is a collection of hands-on networking projects aimed at simulating and understanding key components of modern network infrastructures ‚Äî from basic client-server communication to enterprise-grade security and monitoring systems.

## üîç Purpose

This repo serves as a practical lab environment to:

- Explore foundational networking concepts
- Simulate real-world office and enterprise network setups
- Learn and experiment with security mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS, TLS interception)
- Build an end-to-end understanding of how networks operate and how to secure them

Each project is self-contained and comes with configuration files, documentation, and usage instructions.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Below is a list of planned and ongoing projects. Each project resides in its own directory with detailed instructions.

### ‚úÖ Basic Projects

- **Client-Server File Sharing**  
  Simple TCP/UDP client-server applications for sending files across a network.

- **Custom Firewall Implementation**  
  Using iptables/nftables or Python-based packet filtering to create and manage custom firewall rules.

### üè¢ Office Network Simulation

- **Office Network Layout**  
  Simulating a small office network with routing, subnetting, and basic access control.

- **User and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Implementing user zones and permissions across different network segments.

### üè¢üè¢ Enterprise Network Simulation

- **Traffic Monitoring & Analysis**  
  Using tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, Zeek, or ELK stack for network telemetry and deep packet inspection.

- **TLS Interception with Custom CA**  
  Set up a trusted internal Certificate Authority to inspect encrypted HTTPS traffic securely.

- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**  
  Deploying Snort/Suricata for real-time threat detection.

- **Network Zoning & VLANs**  
  Simulating DMZ, internal, and external zones with segmentation and VLAN tagging.

- **Advanced Access Controls**  
  Integrating role-based access and ACLs for internal/external services.
